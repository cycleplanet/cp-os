The menu is usually quite simple (sometimes the choice is even limited to one menu that everyone is served, very cheap). The quality is variable, but usually acceptable. In the south of Albania, the cuisine is mainly Greek. There are also many pizzas and pastas available. Pilaf (rice with sauce) is a much consumed dish. However, you shouldn't go to Albania for culinary delights. Along the way you will also come across plenty of shops where you can buy some food and drinking water.\r</li><li>(Jurriaan Rot, 2009) I did not get sick from the tap water in the north and north-east, but I was only there for about four days.

It is almost impossible to cycle on it and the only way to get through is to push your bike further.\r</li><li>The Stuart Highway runs through the interior of Australia and connects north and south. Only the Barkly Highway connects the interior with the east coast. Once you leave the highway you will end up on unpaved roads that run right through the desert. There are few or no facilities along the way.\r</li><li>Along the east and southeast coast you will find a denser road network where alternative routes can be made.\r</li><li>To the west, the Great Northern Highway runs from Darwin to Perth. An alternative route is the Gibb River Road, a dirt road covering a distance of more than 600 km between Kununurra and Derby.\r</li><li>South of Perth, on the other hand, there is a denser road network which is an alternative to the sparsely populated areas in the outback and along the west coast.</li></ul><div><b>Best cycling season\r</b></div></div><div><ul><li>Autumn and spring are the best cycling seasons.

Still, it can get quite hot during the summer months, especially around adelaide and melbourne. But don't be surprised by the changeable weather. When the warm wind turns from the north to the cold antarctic winds, the temperature can suddenly drop by more than 20 ° c. Four seasons in one day may well apply here. The best time to cycle here seems to me from october to march.\r</li><li>In july / august the south (sydney-melbourne) is doable.

These can be very profitable from 4 people.\r</li><li>In addition to the caravan parks, there are special camping pitches in the national parks. Different rules apply to this per national park. For example, a permit is required for certain parks and for aborigone land. This permit is often for sale on site at the national park. For some parks, a permit must be arranged in advance. A permit must also be requested in advance for camping outside the designated areas. Wild camping is usually no problem at all.\r</li><li>Camping in national parks is less luxurious. Here you will find the peace that you do not always have on caravan parcs. Usually there is no running water and only a shelf with a hole in it as a toilet. The price you pay for this is negligible. Often you have to register yourself upon arrival.\r</li><li>Wild camping\r</li><li>Wild camping is ideal for spending the night undisturbed, especially in the outback and other remote areas. There is more than enough space to set up your tent somewhere. It is best to find a place a little further from the road where no one will notice you. Wild camping in national parks is prohibited</li></ul>","body_hostels":"<ul><li>You can get hotels from travel guides or through tourist information and flyers at other hotels.

All in all, I think Belarus is a country that you only get to know, by using a guide / translator. Only go out with knowledge of the Russian language, otherwise in a group.

Belgium is famous for their chocolate and their delicious strong beers. The country is mostly flat and therefore easy to cycle. Attractive in Flanders are the many canals and old railway routes along which and over which it is often good and quiet cycling; in addition, the (few remaining) rural areas. In Wallonia, the slopes in the densely forested Ardennes are steeper and longer than many expect, which has already given many novice holiday cyclists the necessary frustrations.

The inland Bosnia region has a moderate continental climate, with hot summers and cold, snowy winters. In the central and eastern interior of the country the geography is mountainous, in the northwest moderately hilly, and in the northeast predominantly flatland.

The Danube flows north of the Balkan Mountains, the border river with Romania. In the plain of the Danube and Balkan Mountains, there are gently undulating wheat fields and fields of sunflowers. The southern mountain region is formed by three densely forested mountain regions, the Rila, Pirin and Rhodope mountains. The latter mountain range is thinner forested towards the east. You will still find numerous monasteries, sometimes still in use. Sofia does not appeal to many cyclists: large gloomy buildings and few terraces. Plovdiv, the second largest city in size, has a beautiful old town. The Black Sea coast is frequented by tourists.

America, especially in the lake area, the Paso Agua Negra and the oases in the north. The south is recommended for everyone, the dirt roads to Illapel are a bit more adventurous, but the Paso Agua Negra is especially for experienced cyclists. There are many cyclists who cycle from the lake area to Tierra del Fuego.<div><br></div><div>The itinerant cyclist, following the adventurous gravel road (Ruta 7, Carretera Austral) from Chaiten to Villa O'Higgins, will notice few historical areas of traditions and culture in the Region X and Region XI regions of Chilean Patagonia. He / She is mainly dependent on the many nature reserves or national parks along the route. On the stretch from Chaiten to Cochrane, the dense rainforests of Pumalin and Queulat National Parks, glacial scenery of Rio Simpson Nature Reserve and wooded mountain scenery in Cerro Castillo Nature Reserve are the attractions of the region. There are plenty of walking and hiking routes in the national parks. In the vicinity of Puyuhuapi there are facilities to take a break from the adventurous journey by using the thermal baths, Termas de Puyuhuapi. Between Cerro Castillo and Cochrane, travelers imagine themselves in a different world, which is mainly determined by the untouched nature and wetlands along the meandering Rio Ibanez and Rio Murta rivers. The last part of the Carretera Austral shows a fairly inaccessible fjord landscape near Puerto Yungay (Tortel district). This piece can be regarded as one of the last wildernesses of Patagonia, where man has not yet intervened. The last part of the gravel road ends in Villa O'Higgins, where the cyclist can make the crossing to Argentina via a ferry. For many cyclists it is a challenge to complete the approx. 20 kilometer long mountain bike route from Candelario Mansilla (Chile) to the lake Lago del Desierto (Argentina) in five hours. The cyclist braves many steep slopes and will make a lot of crossing over the pools in the dense forest, before reaching Argentina.\r</div><div><br></div><div>The tourist attractions of the Region XII region in the very south of Chile are located in the walking &amp; hiking paradise of the world, Torres del Paine. This world-famous park is a worthy end to a journey of discovery through Patagonia. The attraction of the famous Torres del Paine peaks makes many tourists decide to take the nine-kilometer hike so that they can immortalize themselves with the vertical granite towers.\r</div><div><br></div><div>The return trip to the civilized world of Patagonia can be made with a ship from shipping company Navimag. The cruise from Puerto Natales to Puerto Montt, 1500 kilometers away, takes four days and heads north along the Chilean fjords, narrow sea passages (Patagonia Channels) and glaciers. If the sailing schedule and weather conditions permit, you can visit the glacier Amalia. From the boat you have a view of the barren mountain landscapes along the Chilean south coast for days. The low-hanging clouds can obstruct the beautiful view of the Patagonian ice fields.\r</div><div><br></div><div>In the lake district of Patagonia you can find historical areas with traditions and culture of Mapuchu Indians and Jesuits. European influences and the Christian faith have mainly left their traces on the island of Chiloe and in the major cities of the region IX. Several colorful wooden churches are located in the center of picturesque fishing villages and towns. However, the attractions of the Lake District are the many volcanoes and national parks (P.N. Villarrica, P.N. Nahuel Huapi and P.N. Vicente P. Rosales).\r</div><div><br></div><div>The Atacama Desert is very dominant in the north of Chile (Region I and II). In the desert you will find deserted ghost towns near the mining areas. Impressive natural phenomena such as dune formation, moon landscape, volcano tops, vast salt plains and geothermal activities can be found especially at San Pedro de Atacama. In the mountain valleys near the coastal town of Arica, the giant figures drawn on the mainly bare mountain flanks (petroglyphs) and ancient storage sites of the Incas are nice historical sights.\r</div><div><br></div><div>The remote mountain villages are located on the plateau (Altiplano). The remote mountain roads through the national parks show the diversity of flora and fauna. National park P.N. Lauca is recommended for cyclists who cycle from Bolivia to Arica and want to enjoy the many volcano peaks (+ 5000 m) and lakes. In the vicinity of the national park, many houses in mountain villages are deserted. The residents (shepherds) only return during religious festivals.</div>","date_edited":"2021-05-16T17:49:29","user_edited":"01dRgHcnFiTSprDGCEB4Jxq7iDH3"},"FoodDrink":{"body":"<b>Drinking water\r</b><div><b>\r</b></div><div>In general, the tap water is perfectly drinkable, in the cities it has a strong chlorine taste and in Northern Chile drinking is not recommended (not only because of the chlorine, the water simply tastes dirty).\r</div><div><br></div><div><b>Restaurants\r</b></div><div>In the south along the Pan Americana and in the lake district are good restaurants (as in Western Europe).\r</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Shops\r</b></div><div>Even in the smallest villages there are shops selling food and drinks.

In mountain regions (most of China) they cut through the landscape and are a combination of long viaducts and tunnels. This means that the slopes are usually gentle.\r</div><div>Motorways are usually not accessible to cyclists. Sometimes yes: it is possible to cycle on the stretch of highway from 景洪 (jinhong) to 磨憨 (mohan) near the border with Laos. Even though there are big red signs stating that cyclists are not allowed, just look at what the local population does: if they take to the road on foot, by bicycle or by motorcycle, it is in any case allowed to cycle there.\r</div><div>You can also cycle on highways where cyclists are certainly not allowed, nobody will stop you. Although this is at your own risk.\r</div><div>Motorways do not always have a hard lane, especially in mountain areas. Sometimes there are many dozen kilometers between two exits.\r</div><div>Motorways are always toll roads.\r</div><div>Today there are highways in large parts of China. This is good news for cyclists: it relieves other roads. Often there is an “old” road next to the highway. Sometimes there is little traffic on that old road, but this is not guaranteed: if the old road is not a toll road, it is sometimes busier than on the highway itself. After all, the toll is often very expensive. In addition, smaller types and open trucks are no more allowed on the highway than cyclists.\r</div><div>Highways are usually marked on maps with thick yellow strips with two red lines on the outside and a red line in the middle.\r</div><div><ul><li>快速 路 (kuai su lu): expressway\r</li></ul></div><div>It is actually a small highway with no central reservation. The same remarks as for motorways also apply here.\r</div><div>On cards usually thick yellow strips with no red line in the middle. Not all maps show this type of road separately, usually this type of road is marked as a motorway (高速公路).\r</div><div><ul><li>国 道 (guo dao): national road.\r</li></ul></div><div>These are roads of many 1000s kilometers long that cross the country.\r</div><div>They are easily accessible for cyclists.\r</div><div>The quality varies from completely destroyed by heavy trucks to excellent.\r</div><div>The traffic varies from quiet to hellish. Often these roads are used for local transport by small, open trucks (which are not allowed on the highway). They often transport gravel or other building materials. The road then becomes very dusty.\r</div><div>Usually these are not toll roads, but sometimes they are.\r</div><div>国 道 follow the landscape and do not often have long tunnels or bridges.\r</div><div>These are the roads most long-distance cyclists follow. Often for 100s or even 1000s km. It is easy to follow them without getting lost.\r</div><div>It is possible to traverse the country north-south or east-west along these roads.\r</div><div>国 道 always have kilometer markers with the distance to the end of the road.\r</div><div>国 道 always have a three-digit number, sometimes preceded by the letter G. On maps, these roads are usually represented by a red strip or line.\r</div><div><ul><li>省道 (sheng dao): provincial road.\r</li></ul></div><div>These roads run within a province (省). They are similar to the 国 道, but shorter (100s km instead of 1000s)\r</div><div>省道 always have kilometer markers with the distance to the end of the road.\r</div><div>On maps, these roads are usually represented by a green strip or line.\r</div><div><ul><li>县 道 (xian dao): xian way\r</li></ul></div><div>These roads run within a xian (arrondissement). They are not always indicated separately on cards: then they simply fall under the category “other”.\r</div><div><ul><li>Others\r</li></ul></div><div>There are many other minor roads. The quality of these roads varies from excellent smooth asphalt to hard-to-ride dust and stone chunks. And often, during rain, ankle-deep mud.\r</div><div>These smaller roads are also well indicated on maps with a sufficiently small scale. It is necessary to have such a map in order to follow these roads properly. Even with a good map, they are often difficult to follow (due to many exits and intersections that are not properly on the map). A good knowledge of Chinese is recommended in order not to get lost.\r</div><div><u><br></u></div><div><u>Toll\r</u></div><div>Toll never applies to cyclists. Just cycle past the toll booths: there is usually a lane for cyclists on the right-hand side. There is never really any discussion. If a toll is nevertheless charged, refuse to pay. If there was any discussion: when approaching a toll gate, there is always a sign indicating (with drawings) what each type of vehicle must pay. Bicycles are never listed here.\r</div><div><u><br></u></div><div><u>State of the roads\r</u></div><div>The main roads between major cities or industrial areas are well paved. These main roads can be traced well on the map, and certainly on the detailed Chinese maps. To avoid them you often have to choose an illogical route.\r</div><div><br></div><div>The quality of B roads differs per province. In the richer provinces in the east these B-roads are still asphalted, in the less fortunate provinces they are gravel roads, clay pebbles on a hard surface. In the valleys, on small roads along rivers and on the high plains, the roads get worse. The road surface then consists of hardened sand full of potholes.\r</div><div>In the Karakoram the roads are very good and asphalted.\r</div><div>Road works: sometimes roads are interrupted for 10 kilometers due to road works. The result of road works is a very difficult to cycle and dusty road. A highway under construction can be a good alternative to a small mud road. Please note that bridges have already been built and the tunnels are open.\r</div><div><br></div><div><u>Density of the road network\r</u></div><div>In the metropolitan areas with metropolitan cities such as Hong Kong, Zhengzhou, Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin, the density of the road network is highest. These areas are often provided with 3 or more ring roads and the highways cross the cities. In the suburbs it can be very busy with commuting. In the other large metropolises (Xi'an, Kunming, Chengdu) there are many motorways with a few ring roads. The density of the road network in these cities diminishes quite rapidly as one is more than 15 kilometers away from the city center.\r</div><div><br></div><div><u>Traffic density / danger\r</u></div><div>Traffic rules are not actually applied. The cyclist will have to be careful, especially in the big city. On the country roads, Chinese car and truck traffic takes much more account of slow-moving traffic. Foreign tourists should be aware that Chinese car and truck traffic does not automatically give way to cyclists, scooters or pedestrians. This also applies to turning traffic at intersections, entrances and exits, roundabouts or pedestrian crossings. The Chinese drivers of cars and trucks only take slow-moving traffic and pedestrians into account at the very last moment and they place their vehicle in front of the passed vehicle at the last minute, because they no longer have to take into account vehicles behind. They have no insurance and legal liability for what happens behind their vehicle. Keep in mind that every participant in traffic respects each other.\r</div><div>Sticking out your hand with your fingers spread as a stop sign in the direction of the other road user (s) usually works, the other stops. You can use this if you have right of way or if it is very busy to cross. Pay attention to whether the other person responds to it.\r</div><div><br></div><div>It is very busy around the big cities, also with scooters and cyclists. You often come across rotten trucks, ramshackle buses and crackling mopeds that all spit out a lot of smelly exhaust fumes.\r</div><div><br></div><div>In China, the highways (= toll roads, expressways in English) are prohibited for light motorized traffic, pedestrians and cyclists. This is clearly indicated on the traffic information signs at the entrances (toll gates) of the motorways.\r</div><div><u><br></u></div><div><u>Presence of (separate) cycle paths\r</u></div><div>In the vicinity of the major and tourist cities there are separate carriageways along busy national motorways, which are intended for light motorized traffic, pedestrians and cyclists. Chinese car and truck traffic make use of this during overtaking campaigns.\r</div><div>In the center of large cities, there are also separate lanes along the busy city roads, which are intended for light motorized traffic, pedestrians and cyclists.

We always got a very extensive breakfast with lots of fresh fruit and fresh fruit juice. During the day we had little need for food. We have hardly seen any markets, but a few stalls along the road. Outside the cities it is difficult to get food and drink. It is best to bring enough water and some food with you when you leave.\r</div><div><br></div><div>You can enjoy good food at private individuals (paladar, or with an overnight stay in a casa particular). This is in contrast to state restaurants, where there are not much more than beans, rice, fried chicken on the menu.

They can of course ask for a meat-free meal at a casa particular or paladar, although it can become monotonous (it will just be the meal but without meat): lots of rice, beans, green beans, cucumber, mango, banana, oranges, papaya (seasonal).</div><div><br></div><div><b>Shops / supermarkets\r</b></div><div>Food is sometimes difficult to get. So make sure you always have stock with you. There are not many shops, and often there is not much for sale. Exceptions are the tiendas panamericanas, where you can buy convertibles (Cuban) cola and orange, fruit juice, biscuits, rice, pasta, and sometimes cream crackers with pesos. Shops where you can pay with peso MN usually sell cheap alcohol (1 liter of 'firewater' for 3-4 peso MN), refresco's (can of cola 10 peso MN), sandwiches, rice and local cigars etc.\r</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Stalls</b></div><div>Along the way, people sell tasty juices, fruits (bananas, mangos, and pineapples), and sometimes cakes and small nutritious pizzas. Very cheap, but you have to pay with the MN peso.\r</div><div><br></div><div><b>Drinkable water\r</b></div><div>The quality of water varies a lot. It is best to check on the spot. The local population does not purify the water, they often get it from wells. It is important to bring a lot of drink. Bottles of drinking water are available at tiendas panamericanas. Costs 1 peso convertible per 1.5 liters. You need a lot of water, so this will be very expensive.

Ask for a pizzeria or pizza de queso in almost any town and people will send you there. This is usually a private house with a sign.

There is a wide spectrum of possibilities from lighter camping to camping bike rides on the bypass to more extreme expedition-like rides in the highlands where you have to be self-sufficient for many days. Different degrees are also possible, something for everyone. This makes Iceland a wonderful adventure destination.

And you regularly come across places to stock up on new stock. Only in the east you will encounter pieces without asphalt, but they are well paved.</li><li>The interior is a different story, sometimes the road is nothing more than a sandy tire track. Some parts cannot be cycled, you sink into the lava dust, then you are happy that you encounter a washboard, the trick is to cycle on the edge of the washboard to have a grip. Rivers without a bridge are more the rule than the exception and should be taken with caution. Get off, first try without a bicycle, then the bicycle downstream next to you, otherwise it will push you under water. There are no villages in the highlands where you can buy new supplies.

At Kansai International Airport (Osaka), you can buy a bicycle box (lxwxh = 177x23x102 cm).<div><br></div><div>Osaka-Kansai airport is bicycle unfriendly. The airport is located on an artificial island off the coast of Osaka. It is connected to the main land by a 5 km long bridge. You are not allowed to cycle to the airport on the highway (= toll road). You are not allowed to take your bicycle unpackaged on the train, bus, taxi or boat.

He packed his bicycle in a bicycle cover and was allowed to transport the bicycle on the train from Rinku Town to Kansai International Airport. This was only allowed if it was properly packaged and the staff gave an agreement, otherwise he would not get through the entrance gates of the station!\r</div><div><br></div><div>The train station in Rinku Town is 7 km from KIX. From this station there are no more stops to the airport and towing the bicycle to the platform is only 100m incl. Escalator. If you step at other train stations (eg in Osaka), you can tow your packaged bicycle over a great distance and then pick up your luggage. Help from the staff cannot be taken for granted. Every day many Japanese and tourists pass the train stations in the big cities, making it difficult to get your bike on the overcrowded train. Travel to small stations outside the big cities and outside peak hours, the trains are less busy and there is always room for the bike.\r</div><div><br></div><div>Narita Airport is about 70 km from Tokyo.

A folding bicycle in a baby carrier is ideal for Japan. Before you leave, ask for a railway pass that you can no longer buy in Japan. It is quickly cheaper than buying tickets.<div><br><div>In Japan, they can be difficult about taking a non-foldable bicycle on public transport. The bicycle must be completely disassembled and put in a special bag.</div></div><div><br></div><div>The bicycle can be taken on the Shinkansen (bullet train) or local train at no extra cost. No extra costs, but uncertainty whether it will work. You have to take your bike apart and put it in a special bag. Get pedals and steer off. Pack your bike in a pannier or bike cover and find Shinkansen's rear train set. When commenting from station staff, the language barrier helps to get the bike along. Always indicate that you are bringing your bike packed and also show this to the staff. After approval you buy a normal train ticket and surcharge ticket (express service for Shinkansen). There is not much space in the Shinkansen, so travel outside rush hour (07: 00-10: 00 and 16: 00-19: 00). There is space to place the dismantled bicycle behind the last row of seats or the rear aisle of the last train set. Train layout is clearly indicated on the platform by Japanese Railways. Another option is to send the bicycle separately via the Shinkansen. JR offers this possibility.

Via Podgorica and NW Albania to Gusinje. The view from the Grbaje valley on the Prokletije mountains should also be beautiful but we had too much cloud.

It really depends on the region how good the supply points are. For example, you don't get fresh vegetables, bread or groceries for dinner everywhere. We usually take some pasta, lentils, cereal and hard vegetables with us for off road trips because some shops have very scant supplies such as just cookies. Because Morocco is quite densely populated, water is never a problem. We tap at the last village just before wild camping. Please note that in very dry regions you do not take water with people who have had to lug around for a long time every day.</div><div><br></div><div>Tajine is a stew with or without meat and very tasty, stewed in delicious herbs (rash el hanout). Most tajines are with meat, along the coast also with fish. The special herbs for this are for sale on the markets. Harira (soup) is made from chickpeas and is an excellent bicycle food. Fried fish (sardines) is especially cheap, sometimes served with fried chips. You are often offered couscous at people's homes.\r</div><div><br></div><div>Bread comes in flat round format or in the form of baguettes.

In the cities the water is chlorinated, this does not have to be a problem for drinkability as long as you give it time to let the chlorine evaporate, possibly add a dash of lemon juice against the bad taste. In the mountains there is wonderfully fresh water that is easy to drink without purification (watch out for contamination downstream!) In the less populated areas it is advisable to take enough water with you at the start. (Mineral) water in bottles is widely available everywhere, with the exception of the small remote places. Wilbert drank the water everywhere from the tap or from wells without filtering. This is not wise but has not caused any problems. Cola and other soft drinks are very cheap. Tea is the national drink, it contains an unimaginable amount of sugar. Sometimes mint or other herbs are added. Offering hospitality is always accompanied by offering tea. If it is elaborate, then they serve in three courses that you are supposed to sit out completely. Sometimes it takes more than an hour to drink. In more and more places and above all in Marrakech you will find freshly squeezed orange juice. According to the average Moroccan that is very sour ... with \"a little\" sugar much better! And beware, some people add sugar and water to earn more money.\r</div><div><br></div><div>In many places you can buy delicious fresh fruit juices in all kinds of flavors.

The country confronts the cyclist with the great mutual distance between places, which the experienced cyclist cannot bridge in a day. In the south of Namibia it is not inconceivable that the next town is more than 200 kilometers away and that wild camping is necessary. Namibia experiences a prolonged heat wave in the summer, during which the sun burns brightly for hours and the cloudless sky remains a clear blue. The Namibian summer has few bearable and cool cycling days. The open desert areas offer the cyclist hardly any protection against the scorching heat, because there are no cool shadows along the roads.<div><br><div></div><div>Namibia offers the itinerant cyclist many impressive natural phenomena and beautiful views of unique, sometimes surreal landscapes. Rock formations and the red sand dunes reflect the color nuances during the rising and setting of the sun, changing the landscape image after a few minutes. The country is partly divided into two large desert areas, viz. Namib and Kalahari desert in resp. the west and east of the country. Despite the presence of deserts, the country has a biodiversity of flora and fauna in the Namib desert and the country can be divided into various ecosystems, which enjoy protection in the form of national parks and nature reserves.\r</div><div><br></div><div>The gravity factors that determine the cycling tours in Namibia are mainly the presence of sometimes poorly maintained gravel roads, the western headwind from the sea and the gradual kilometer-long climb to the high plateaus. In the remote areas, the high summer temperatures and the extra baggage of water (approx. 15 litres) do influence cycling performance and one should absolutely not underestimate dehydration, heat and the blazing sun. The itinerant cyclist cannot escape the high plateau in the central part of Namibia, which is not always easy to conquer with a heavily loaded bicycle. The Khomas region contains the hilly areas of the country, where the English term 'rolling hills' applies. Gradient gradient from sea level to the plateau (from Walvis Bay to Windhoek) is often false flat for more than tens of kilometers.</div><div>\r</div></div>","date_edited":"2021-06-03T16:20:08","user_edited":"01dRgHcnFiTSprDGCEB4Jxq7iDH3"},"FoodDrink":{"body":"<div>Nambia is a meat country.

Those who cycle in the Namib desert will certainly not miss the biodiversity of the area. The desert can be divided into various ecosystems. In the south of the Namib desert (Succulent Karoo) the cyclist encounters various desert plants (succulents) and wild flowers, which are only in full bloom in spring. In the arid (dry) desert areas in the north of the Namib desert, flora and fauna can be found, which can survive under extreme weather and climate conditions. The diverse ecosystems are located in various national parks and nature reserves, so that untouched nature reserves can still be found on the route from Noordoewer to Walvisbay. The presence of different ecosystems and impressive natural phenomena such as rock (de)formations and erosion make cycling in the oldest desert in the world a unique experience with many highlights (Sossusvlei, Namib Rand Nature Reserve, Namib Desert Park, Neisip Plain, Orange River).\r</div><div><br></div><div>About half of the beautiful cycling routes in the Namib desert are located on a plateau, which is not always easy to conquer with a heavily loaded bicycle. Gradients from sea level to the plateau are often false flats for more than tens of kilometers. Below is an overview of the nice cycling routes in the Namib desert:\r</div><div><ul><li>Those entering Namibia from South Africa can cycle along the Orange River (Gariep) via the villages of Noordoewer and Aussenkehr to Rosh Pinah and will enjoy the great wine regions and scenic, rugged mountain landscapes along the river. The most beautiful part of the river is located in the Ai-Ais/Richtersveld National Park and is easily accessible from the Fish River Canyon.</li><li>The gravel road D707 is one of the beautiful routes that you can cycle in the Namib desert. The tourist route is about 50 kilometers south of the town of Helmeringhausen and leads you along the vast pale yellow desert plain (Neisip Plain). You also have a view of the mountain ranges or the red sand dunes of the Namib Desert. On this route you have several accommodation options, if you do not want to camp in the wild.</li><li>Nature and animal lovers cycle early in the morning in the Namib Rand Nature Reserve, which is surrounded by the Naukluft mountain range. The lucky ones will see giraffes, springbok etc. and in the future perhaps rhinoceroses, which will be placed in the area.\r</li><li>The fanatics cycle the infamous 230 kilometer long gravel road C14 from Walvis Bay to Solitaire and experience the real Namibia. In the vicinity of Kuiseb Pass and Gaub Pass, the gigantic deformations of rock layers dominate and the cyclist experiences the heaviness of the very hilly part in the Namib-Naukluft Park. The road from Kuiseb Canyon to Walvis Bay is located in an open sandy plain (Namib Desert Park), with dune formation along the road clearly visible.</li></ul><div><b>National parks &amp; nature reserves</b></div></div><div>When entering many national parks and nature reserves in Namibia, the visitor needs an admission ticket (permit). Here's an overview of where you may or may not need tickets to enter national parks and nature reserves:\r</div><div><ul><li>You do not need a permit for Ai-Ais Richtersveld NP, Namib Naukluft Park (follow highway D707) and Namib Nature Rand Reserve.\r</li><li>Namib Naukluft Desert Park you need a permit if you cycle towards Homeb (research station).\r</li><li>For Sossusvlei you pay an entrance fee, and you can cycle to the famous dunes. It is 65 km by bike (about 200 to 300 h.m) on a well-paved road and the last 2 to 4 km you will have to enter by car, because it is a 4WD track.\r</li><li>In Etosha NP there are roaming wild animals such as elephants, buffalo, lions, rhinoceroses and leopards, so you are not allowed to enter the park with an open vehicle.\r</li><li>You can cycle to Skeleton Coast NP, provided you have reserved an overnight stay in Tora Bay. Due to the great distance to Tora Bay, the cyclist will probably not be allowed in the park. If you are admitted, you pay an entrance fee and you cycle on hard, sometimes sandy roads.</li></ul><div><b>Best time to cycle</b></div></div><div>The high season starts from mid-December to the end of January and many South Africans book the cheapest sleeping accommodation. Early December kicks off the preseason and overnight accommodations in some cities like Rosh Pinah fill up quickly.\r</div><div><br></div><div><u>Wind</u></div><div>The wind can be a problem, some days it is stormy and it is hard. The predominant direction is west to southwest. At Walvis Bay and Luderitz you will encounter a lot of resistance from the strong westerly wind from the sea. From Rosh Pinah (+300 m) to Aus you will cycle twice to the plateau (Huib Hoch plateau, +1400 m) within a distance of 167 kilometers and you will experience a lot of hindrance from the wind from the north.<br></div><div><u><br></u></div><div><u>Average temperature</u></div><div>September is a good period for cycling as it is spring in Namibia with a temperature of around 25 degrees. It is nice and cool along the coast. Later in the year it gets hotter, often above 35 degrees. May, the start of the Namibian winter, is also a great period. The average temperature is about 25 degrees. In the evening it cools down quite a bit. The rainy season has just ended, so the country is still relatively green.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Spare parts</b></div><div>Outside of Windhoek or Swakopmund, there are few or no parts for randonneurs available. The situation outside these cities is better for ATBs, although there are no high-tech gear for sale.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Due to the bad roads and the fact that sometimes quite a bit of weight (water) has to be carried, good equipment is required. In any case, take a spare tire and spokes with you. The sand causes the chain and derailleurs to suffer quite a bit, so good maintenance is necessary. Also check from time to time that all bolts are still tight.\r</div><div><br></div><div>Before the start of the cycling tours in Namibia, make sure that the bicycle is well prepared for long trips on the sand and gravel roads. Placing a hard plastic ribbon inside the tire offers sufficient protection against tiny sharp thorns and sharp gravel stones. Check the tire for small cracks, which appear after thousands of kilometers of cycling. These cracks in most cases cause punctures. The cyclist will have to be wary of thin long spines of plants and shrubs along the roads.\r</div><div><br></div><div>Even in touristic places like Sesriem near the Sossusvlei you can't go for bicycle repairs. The bicycle repair shops can only be found in the major cities. The cyclist, who is on his way from South Africa to Namibia, will find a good bicycle specialist in Springbok before the Namibian border is reached after about 120 kilometers.</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div><div>\r</div>","date_edited":"2021-06-03T16:40:01","user_edited":"01dRgHcnFiTSprDGCEB4Jxq7iDH3"},"People":{"body":"Contact is no problem with the Namibians of European descent and they are hospitable.

In good conditions it is possible to climb the volcano, but you can also walk passed it. In wintertime you need to prepare a little better with crampons and maybe even an icehax.

The DOC (Department Of Conservation) DOC manages New Zealand's national parks, forests, reserves, riverbanks, coasts and wetlands. The DOC provides 2 leaflets (North and South Island) with an overview of these nature campsites. The facilities at these campsites are usually minimal, but they are located in the most beautiful places... Usually you will find a fire pit and water. A small contribution is requested for the use and maintenance of the campsite. You can leave this money in an envelope in a special mailbox at the campsite. The DOC campsites are highly recommended, although it can get busy in high season. There is always a place for a couple of cyclists. Click here for an overview of DOC campsites (choose Parks &amp; Recreation section, then Places to stay and finally Conservation campsites by region).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, you can also ask a landowner to pitch your tent on his piece of land.

The founder Bas came in touch with bike touring during his backpack trip in Central Asia, where one of the most popular routes among bike toureres appeared to be. A world of opportunities opened for him, as a bike can take you gain an incredible amount of freedom. Bas was sold, and started his own world trip a few years later, in 2019. The original idea was to go from The Netherlands, towards Cape Town via West Africa, go to Asia via East Africa, then Oceania, sail the Great Ocean and then cycle South and North America. All of this came to an abrubt end after having cycled 20.000 km in one year and through some of the thougest countires in the world. Just a few days removed from the South African border, Bas had to fly home from Namibia, after the corona epidemic took control of the world.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">During Bas his trip, finding information about visas, border crossings, embassies and other subjects was possible with places like Facebook groups, Whatsapp groups and iOverlander, but could definelty be better and more bike touring specific. The ultimate source of information could be a bike touring platform, in which users can add and edit information based on their own experiences. Small ideas started to grow into something larger, like the possibilities to let users find each other and interact with each other.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">Starting with little knowledge about coding, Bas started to learn making an android app. In September 2020 the first version of the android app was lauched, but soon realised that only an android app wouldn't be sufficient, and a website and iOs app should be released as well. Starting again with little knowledge about coding a website, Bas found out that a single sourcecode could be made to create a platform on all 3 major user devices.</font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">Having launched the first version of the website and the apps for both Android and iOs in January 2021, a major step has been made.</font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">And even after the launch, new and promising ideas are still coming up (like recording your trip, translate system, adding routes, a social feed system and more). To be continued!</font></div>"},"Privacy policy":{"section1":"<p class=\"text-h5\" style=\"font-family: customfont;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; font-size: 14px;\">Last updated 18-12-2020</span><br></p><p class=\"text-bold\" style=\"font-family: customfont;\">General note from founder Bas Idsinga: As comlicated as these privacy policies may be, I have not a single intention to abbuse the data that is collected through Cycle Planet.
